    <h1>Tabletop Cafes</h1>

    <h2>A community that should be preserved is public tabletop gaming spaces. It not only brings together people in communities but also gets people into things that they may not have access to otherwise. The space historically brought together people of similar interest and gave people a space to hang out at and meet new people.
In my community there isn't a lot of cheap places for teens to just hangout and meet new people this cafe is a fun place to meet up and have fun</h2>
    <p>This is for everyone in the community who like tabletop games or want to learn more about them or participate in them.
The problem is the lack of spaces for people to go outside of school and work and places to meet other people in person who also like things like tabletop gaming
It is an area or people who can just come and find campaigns to join or start their own or mingle together
My inspiration is the artist spaces in cafes where people can post their art on the wall and put things on the whiteboard
